## Lab 4.1: Introduction to Bayesian: Binomial Data

In this lab, we will analyze binomial data in a Bayesian framework with a couple of different prior distributions for $p$. The first prior for $p$ will be a non-informative prior while the second prior for $p$ will be based on "expert" (your!) opinion prior to the analysis.

To start, consider your own prowess at the popular game "flip cup" and your (self-assessed) probability of successfully flipping the cup so that it's upside-down. Use the app at <http://shiny.stlawu.edu:3838/sample-apps/stat325/distplot/> to drag the sliders around until you settle on a reasonable informative prior distribution for the probability that you successfully flip a cup from right-side-up to upside-down (note that you should not use a non-informative prior here). In general:

* increasing $\alpha$ will shift the distribution to the right.
* increasing $\beta$ will shift the distribution to the left.
* increasing both will give a distribution with less variability.

Write down the parameters you will use for your informative prior of you successfully flipping a cup.

In comparison, we will also use a `Beta(1, 1)` = `Uniform(0, 1)` prior distribution for $p$. This is a non-informative prior.

After you have settled on your informative prior, use the code below to construct a plot of both the informative prior and the non-informative prior.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
ps <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000)

informative_alpha <- 2
informative_beta <- 4

noninformative_alpha <- 1
noninformative_beta <- 1

informative_prior <- dbeta(ps, informative_alpha,
                           informative_beta)
noninformative_prior <- dbeta(ps,
                              noninformative_alpha, noninformative_beta)
prior_plot <- tibble(ps, informative_prior, noninformative_prior) |>
  pivot_longer(2:3, names_to = "prior_type", values_to = "density")

ggplot(data = prior_plot, aes(x = ps, y = density, colour = prior_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "p")
```

__Exercise__. With our informative prior and our non-informative prior, we will now collect some data to include in our bayesian analysis. After you collect data, derive the posterior distribution of $p$ using both the noninformative prior and the informative prior. Then, adjust the code above to produce a plot of your two posterior distributions.

```{r}
## put code to make your posterior distribution plot here
```

__Exercise__. For each posterior, compute the posterior mean.

__Exercise__. For each posterior, compute a 95% credible interval for $p$.

__Exercise__. The informative prior that you used was very subjective, based on your own knowledge and thoughts of how well you can play flip cup. What do you think can be done to limit the subjectivity of this prior?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
# need to find an alpha and beta that simultaneously have alpha/(alpha+beta) = 1/6
# and variance = 0.001

mean = 1/6   # set a target for the mean = alpha/(alpha+beta) of our beta distribution

df = alphas = seq(0.1,50,by=0.05)
betas = alphas*(1/mean - 1)

vars = (alphas*betas) / ( (alphas+betas)^2  * (alphas+betas+1)  )# find the variance for each combo of alpha and beta
targetvar = 0.001

index = which.min( abs(vars - targetvar)  )  # compare the probs to our target; find closest one

alphas[index]
betas[index]
vars[index]


#plot prior
curve(dbeta(x,alphas[index],betas[index]),from=0,to=1)

```

## Lab 4.2: More Bayesian: Poisson Data

Recall from probability that we discussed using a Poisson model to model the number of goals that the St. Lawrence women's hockey team scores in a game. In that class, we assumed that we knew the value of $\lambda$ in that probability model and we computed a few quantities of interest under that assumption. 

Usually, however, $\lambda$ must be estimated (in a frequentist analysis) using data, or, in a Bayesian analysis, we can provide a probability model for $\lambda$ itself that is either non-informative or informed by expert opinion or prior data.

Suppose that the women's hockey coach says that he thinks their team scores about 3 goals per game, on average. When pressed for how "sure" they are of that answer and to give a reasonable range for what values that goal scoring rate is, they reply that they are not quite sure. But, they know that they are almost certain that the scoring rate is no less than 2 goals per game, on average. 

As discussed in class, the conjugate prior for Poisson data is the Gamma distribution, which can be used to model $\lambda$. Using the coach's information, come up with an informative prior for $\lambda$ with the Gamma distribution. Note that we will have some decisions to make in how to use the coach's information to come up with an informative prior!

```{r}
## put work for informative prior here
```

A relatively non-informative prior for $\lambda$ is a Gamma distribution with very small values for both $\alpha$ and $k$. Note that, for the gamma distribution, I am replacing $\lambda$ with $k$, so that we are not working with two different $\lambda$'s (since the Poisson also has a parameter called $\lambda$). Using $\alpha = 0.001$ and $k = 0.001$, construct a plot of a relatively non-informative prior for $\lambda$ using the code below.

```{r}
alpha <- 0.001
k <- 0.001
lambda_grid <- seq(0, 5, length.out = 1000)
gamma_density <- dgamma(lambda_grid, shape = alpha, rate = k)
gamma_plot <- tibble(lambda_grid, gamma_density)
ggplot(data = gamma_plot, aes(x = lambda_grid, y = gamma_density)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()
```

__Exercise__. Based on the plot of the non-informative prior, it's a little difficult to see _why_ this prior is non-informative. However, using what we derived as the posterior distribution for $\lambda$, construct an argument for why a prior of $\alpha = 0.001$ and $k = 0.001$ is a non-informative prior.

__Exercise__. Using the code above, construct a plot of the informative prior we derived earlier.

Now suppose that we collect data from the women's hockey team this season to update both our non-informative prior and our informative prior with data to obtain two posterior distributions for the goal rate.

The code below pulls in data from the season:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(rvest)
url <- "https://saintsathletics.com/sports/womens-ice-hockey/stats/2024-25"
tab <- read_html(url) |> 
  html_nodes("table")
hockey_stats <- tab[[6]] |> html_table(header = FALSE) 

newnames <- paste(hockey_stats[1, ], hockey_stats[2, ])
goals <- hockey_stats |> set_names(newnames) |>
  slice(-1, -2) |>
  mutate(`Shots G` = as.numeric(`Shots G`)) |>
  filter(`Shots G` <= 20) |> ## filter out the totals (hoping that the women
## never scored more than 20 goals in one game!!)
  pull(`Shots G`) |> as.numeric()
goals
```

__Exercise__. Using this data and the posterior that we computed in class, figure out the posterior distribution for the goal rate with the non-informative prior and with the informative prior.

__Exercise__. Construct a plot of each of the posterior distributions.

__Exercise__. The mean of the posterior distribution must always be between the mean of the prior distribution and the mean of the data, as the posterior is a "compromise" between the prior and the observed data. Verify that this is the case for this example.

__Exercise__. With each posterior, compute a 95% credible interval for $\lambda$, the rate that the women's hockey team scores goals.

__Exercise__. Think back to the data that we used for this example. What assumptions have we made to complete this analysis? Can you think of ways that we might relax these assumptions?


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
alpha = 0.01
lambda = 0.01
curve(dgamma(x,alpha,lambda),from=0,to=10)
alpha/lambda   # prior mean
alpha/lambda^2 # prior variance

# need to find an alpha and lambda that simultaneously have the desired mean and target probability

mean =    # set a target for the mean = alpha/lambda of our gamma distribution

alphas = seq(0.01,50,by=0.01)
lambdas = alphas/mean   # find the lambda that when combined with a specific alpha yields the desired mean


prob = pgamma(2, alphas, lambdas)  # find the desired probability for each combo of alpha and lambda
targetprob =                 # our (subjective!) definition of "pretty sure"

index = which.min( abs(prob - targetprob)  )  # compare the probs to our target; find closest one

alphas[index]
lambdas[index]


#plot prior
curve(dgamma(x,alphas[index],lambdas[index]),from=0,to=10)

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
library(rvest)
url <- "https://saintsathletics.com/sports/womens-ice-hockey/stats/2023-24"
tab <- read_html(url) |> 
  html_nodes("table")
hockey_stats <- tab[[6]] |> html_table(header = FALSE) 

newnames <- paste(hockey_stats[1, ], hockey_stats[2, ])
goals <- hockey_stats |> set_names(newnames) |>
  slice(-1, -2) |>
  slice(-40, -41) |> ## drop totals

Rafael Nadal is arguably the greatest men's clay-court tennis player ever to play the game. In this mini-project, you analyze the probability that Nadal wins a point on his own serve against his primary rival, Novak Djokovic, at the French Open (the most prestigious clay court tournament in the world).

### Priors

Before we look at some data, we will consider a few possible prior distributions for the probability that Nadal wins a point on his own serve against Djokovic:

- non-informative prior for this probability.
- an informative prior based on a clay-court match the two played in the previous year. In that match, Nadal won 46 out of 66 points on his own serve. The standard error of this estimate is 0.05657. 
- an informative prior based on a sports announcer, who claims that they think Nadal wins about 75% of the points on his serve against Djokovic. They are also "almost sure" that Nadal wins no less than 70% of his points on serve against Djokovic.

Construct a single graph that shows all three of these priors. Note that, for both of the informative priors, there is some subjectivity with how you are going to use the information given to construct an appropriate prior for $p$, the probability that Nadal wins a point on serve against Djokovic.

### Data

Now, we want to use the 2020 French Open data to update our prior for the probability that Nadal wins a point on serve. In that tournament, the two players played in the final. In that final, Nadal served 84 points and won 56 of those points.

Update each of your three priors with this data and make a plot of the three different posterior distributions of $p$.

Additionally, for each of the three posteriors, report the posterior mean and 90% credible intervals for $p$.

### Report

For this mini-project, you should submit a report that includes the following:

- an introduction to the question of interest that you are answering for this project as well as an overview of how you will be answering this question.
- typed work justifying the decisions you made to create the two informative priors. What did you assume when you made those priors?
- the graph of the three priors and the graph of the three posteriors, along with any work needed to obtain the posteriors, the posterior means, and the 90% credible intervals
- a comparison of the three posteriors. 
    - They should be a bit different from each other: why? 
    - If you had to choose one to use, which one would you choose here and why? 
    - The variance of each posterior should be different. Why do you think one posterior has a lower variance than the other two?
- a brief conclusion of what you found in this mini-project.
