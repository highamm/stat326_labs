# Course Information

Welcome to STAT 326. The purpose of this course is to strengthen statistical reasoning skills, applying the foundational tools learned in MATH/STAT 325 to more statistical contexts.

## General Course Outcomes

1. Given a probability model, derive a point estimator for parameter(s) in that model using data.

2. Describe properties of what might make an estimator "good."

3. Given a probability model, derive an interval estimator for parameter(s) in that model using data. 

4. Explain the difference between a "frequentist approach" to statistics and a "Bayesian approach" to statistics.

5. Derive and conduct hypothesis tests about parameters in a probability model using classical statistics tests and simulation-based permutation tests.

6. Use statistical simulation to answer questions about how statistical methods work and how violations of assumptions of statistical methods impact results.

## Use of `R` and `RStudio`

We will use `RStudio` throughout the semester as a tool to help us understand concepts in this course.

* `R` and `R Studio` are both free to use.
* You should already have both `R` and `R Studio` installed on your personal computer from MATH/STAT 325. 
* The purpose of this class is not to learn `R` in detail. The concepts for the course receive a strong priority.

# Assessment

There are 1000 total points that can be earned in this course from components described below. An up-to-date list of all relevant due dates and exam dates will be found on Canvas.

<br>

## Assessments 

There will be 5 100-point assessments throughout the semester, given on Wednesdays. For each assessment, you are allowed to bring a double-sided sheet of handwritten notes. More details about what you might expect on these assessments will be provided closer to the date of the first assessment.

Additionally, 100 points will be given to the average of your highest 4 assessments. Therefore, the total number of points from assessments will be 600 points.

## Mini-Projects

On many of the Wednesdays on "off-weeks" (weeks where you do not have an assessment), you will complete five different mini-projects. The topics of these mini-projects vary widely from project to project, but, by the end of the semester, you can expect to have completed statistical simulation studies, a meaningful story, a Bayesian data analysis, and an analysis on the benefits and drawbacks of using p-values in statistics.

Each mini-project will be worth 30 points, for a total of 150 points.

<br>

## Homework Assignments

Weekly Homeworks are worth 10 points each and are due most weeks on __Mondays__. Homeworks will be graded for both correctness and completion, though you will be given "checkpoints" on each homework problem so that you can check your work as you go along. 

One homework will be dropped from your grade so the total number of points from Homework Assignments will be 90 points.

You may work with other students on the homeworks, but please make sure to read the [Rules for Collaboration](#rules-for-collaboration) section before doing so. If you need additional help outside of collaboration with classmate or office hours, the Peterson Quantitative Research Center (PQRC) in Valentine Hall is a great resource! 

<!-- * you should submit to Canvas your completed homework assignment (you can either submit pictures or you can scan a PDF using one of the campus scanners: I'm not picky about format). You need to have attempted every part of every problem in this submission to receive full credit for this part of the homework. After you submit to Canvas, a file of solutions will be made available to you: you'll then use this file of solutions to "grade" your homework. Make sure to give yourself enough time to grade your homework and make any necessary corrections! -->
<!-- * by __Wednesday__'s class time, you should submit a hard copy of a graded copy of your homework. Using the file of solutions, you should explicitly grade yourself using a different coloured pen and assign yourself points for each of the homework problems, giving yourself an overall grade out of 15. __This will not be your recorded grade for the homework assignment__. Instead, for each incorrect problem, you should write a corrected version in different coloured ink, writing a short explanation for any error made in the original submission. If your corrections are sufficient, you will receive the full 15 points for the homework.   -->

<br>

## Recap Tasks

In addition to homework assignments, you will also be assigned "recap tasks" to complete by the start of class every Monday. The purpose of these recap tasks is to give you additional practice on concepts discussed in class. Each recap task is worth 5 points. There will be 13 recap tasks throughout the semester, and one recap task will be dropped from your grade. Therefore, there are 60 points to be earned from these recap tasks.

You may not use AI on recap tasks, unless otherwise stated.

<br>

## Final Portfolio

A final portfolio will be assigned near the end of the semester. More details will be provided later, but the total number of points for this final portfolio is 100 points.

## Point Allocation

The 1000 points possible for the class will be allocated in the following way:

* Assessments: __600 points__: 100 points for each of 5 in-class assessments, plus 100 additional points for the average of your top 4 assessments.
* Mini-Projects: __150 points__: 30 points for each of 5 mini-projects, none of which will be dropped from your grade.
* Homework Assignments: __90 points__: 10 Homeworks for 10 points each for a total of 90 points (with one of the 10-point homeworks dropped).
* Recap Tasks: __60 points__: 13 recap tasks, each worth 5 points, with one recap task dropped from your grade, for a total of 60 points.
* Portfolio: __100 points__: 1 final portfolio. Details of what will go in your final portfolio will be described later.

# Collaboration, Diversity, Accessibility, and Academic Integrity

## Rules for Collaboration

You __are__ allowed to collaborate with your classmates (or your classmates from the other section of this course) for homework assignments and handouts with the following rules.

* you must state the name(s) of who you collaborated with at the top of each assessment.
* all work must be your own. Even if you work with someone else, you must write your answers on your own. Therefore, I expect your answers to free response questions to be at least slightly different from the person(s) you collaborated with.
* you must not copy answers directly from the Internet or directly from the homework solutions file.
* this isn't a rule, but keep in mind that collaboration is not permitted on any of the exams. Therefore, when working with someone, make sure that you are both really learning so that you both can have success on the exam assessments.

## AI Policy

Throughout the semester, we will use generative AI (specifically, ChatGPT) to aid us in performing basic calculations and in evaluating integrals. For homework assignments and mini-projects, the policy on AI usage will be stated at the top of the assignment. For recap tasks, you may not use AI to assist in coming up with your answer. Make sure that you follow this policy. While AI can be a tool to enhance your learning, becoming overly reliant on it prevents the growth of logical thinking skills.

***

## Diversity Statement

Diversity encompasses differences in age, colour, ethnicity, national origin, gender, physical or mental ability, religion, socioeconomic background, veteran status, sexual orientation, and marginalized groups. The interaction of different human characteristics brings about a positive learning environment. Diversity is both respected and valued in this classroom.

## Academic Integrity

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Any specific policies for this course are supplementary to the

Honor Code. According to the St. Lawrence University Academic Honor Policy,

1. It is assumed that all work is done by the student unless the instructor/mentor/employer gives specific permission for collaboration.
2. Cheating on examinations and tests consists of knowingly giving or using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance during examinations or tests.
3. Dishonesty in work outside of examinations and tests consists of handing in or presenting as original work which is not original, where originality is required.

*Claims of ignorance and academic or personal pressure are unacceptable as excuses for academic dishonesty.* Students must learn what constitutes one&#39;s own work and how the work of others must be acknowledged.

For more information, refer to [www.stlawu.edu/acadaffairs/](../../C:%5CUsers%5Ciramler%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cwww.stlawu.edu%5Cacadaffairs%5Cacademic_honor_policy.pdf)[**academic**](../../C:%5CUsers%5Ciramler%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cwww.stlawu.edu%5Cacadaffairs%5Cacademic_honor_policy.pdf)[\_](../../C:%5CUsers%5Ciramler%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cwww.stlawu.edu%5Cacadaffairs%5Cacademic_honor_policy.pdf)[**honor**](../../C:%5CUsers%5Ciramler%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cwww.stlawu.edu%5Cacadaffairs%5Cacademic_honor_policy.pdf)[\_policy.pdf](../../C:%5CUsers%5Ciramler%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cwww.stlawu.edu%5Cacadaffairs%5Cacademic_honor_policy.pdf).

To avoid academic dishonesty, it is important that you follow all directions and collaboration rules and ask for clarification if you have any questions about what is acceptable for a particular assignment or exam.  If I suspect academic dishonesty, a score of zero will be given for the entire assignment in which the academic dishonesty occurred **for all individuals involved** and Academic Honor Council will be notified. If a pattern of academic dishonesty is found to have occurred, a grade of 0.0 for the entire course can be given.

It is important to work in a way that maximizes your learning. Be aware that students who rely too much on others for the homework and projects tend to do poorly on the quizzes and exams.

_Please note that in addition the above, any assignments in which your score is reduced due to academic dishonesty will not be dropped according to the homework policy e.g., if you receive a zero on a homework because of academic dishonesty, it will not be dropped from your grade._
