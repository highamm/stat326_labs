    "text": "Starting a Simulation\nTo begin a simulation for a sampling distribution of a sample statistic, we need to choose:\n\na population model for the simulation. Let’s start with Normal(\\(\\mu\\) = 10, \\(\\sigma^2\\) = 4).\na sample size for the simulation. Let’s start with \\(n\\) = 5.\na calculation for the sample statistic that we are constructing the sampling distribution of. Let’s start with the sample mean, \\(\\bar{y}\\).\n\n\n\nGenerating a Single Sample Statistic\nCarefully look through this code and output to understand the process of generating a single sample from a population and computing a statistic.\nIn the code below, we simulate five observations from a normal population with mean 10 and standard deviation 2. Note that, when you run the code, you should get a different set of 5 numbers than the ones printed below: it is a random sample, after all!\n\nn &lt;- 5       # sample size\nmu &lt;- 10     # population mean\nsigma &lt;- 2   # population standard deviation\n\n# generate a random sample of n observations from a normal population\nsingle_sample &lt;- rnorm(n, mu, sigma) |&gt; round(2)\n# look at the sample\nsingle_sample \n\n[1]  9.92 10.57  8.13  9.40  9.23\n\n\nNext, we compute the sample mean from this sample: this is our sample statistic we are interested in.\n\n# compute the sample mean\nsample_mean &lt;- mean(single_sample)\n# look at the sample mean\nsample_mean     \n\n[1] 9.45\n\n\nAgain, your sample mean should be different!\nFinally, we can make a plot of our single sample, along with where the sample mean lies.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# generate a range of values that span the population\nplot_df &lt;- tibble(xvals = seq(mu - 4 * sigma, mu + 4 * sigma, length.out = 500)) |&gt;\n  mutate(xvals_density = dnorm(xvals, mu, sigma))\n\n## plot the population model density curve\nggplot(data = plot_df, aes(x = xvals, y = xvals_density)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ## add the sample points from your sample\n  geom_jitter(data = tibble(single_sample), aes(x = single_sample, y = 0),\n              width = 0, height = 0.005) +\n  ## add a line for the sample mean\n  geom_vline(xintercept = sample_mean, colour = \"red\") +\n  labs(x = \"y\", y = \"density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructing the Sampling Distribution\nTo simulate the sampling distribution of the sample mean from a normal population with \\(\\mu\\) = 10 and \\(\\sigma\\) = 2 for a sample size of 5, we need to repeat the above steps many, many, many times. We can do so by\n\nWriting a function that computes the sample mean and then\nMapping through that function a large number of times and then\nPlotting the large number of sample means to examine the characteristics of the resulting distribution.\n\nFirst, let’s write the function that will compute the sample mean with a given sample size from a normal population model with a given mean and standard deviation.\n\nn &lt;- 5            # sample size\nmu &lt;- 10          # population mean\nsigma &lt;- 2        # population standard deviation\n\ngenerate_samp_mean &lt;- function(mu, sigma, n) {\n  \n  single_sample &lt;- rnorm(n, mu, sigma)\n  sample_mean &lt;- mean(single_sample)\n  \n  return(sample_mean)\n}\n\n## test function once:\ngenerate_samp_mean(mu = mu, sigma = sigma, n = n)\n\n[1] 10.23156\n\n\nNext, to generate 5000 sample means, we map through the function:\n\nnsim &lt;- 5000      # number of simulations\n\n## code to map through the function. \n## the \\(i) syntax says to just repeat the generate_samp_mean function\n## nsim times\nmeans &lt;- map_dbl(1:nsim, \\(i) generate_samp_mean(mu = mu, sigma = sigma, n = n))\n\n## print some of the 5000 means\n## each number represents the sample mean from __one__ sample.\nmeans_df &lt;- tibble(means)\nmeans_df\n\n# A tibble: 5,000 × 1\n   means\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  9.39\n 2  9.84\n 3  8.81\n 4  9.48\n 5  9.59\n 6  9.24\n 7 11.3 \n 8 10.3 \n 9  9.88\n10  8.53\n# ℹ 4,990 more rows\n\n\nFinally, we plot the 5000 sample means to see what our sampling distribution of the sample mean (for a sample size of 5) looks like.\n\nggplot(data = means_df, aes(x = means)) +\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"deeppink4\", fill = \"deeppink1\", bins = 20) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Observed Sample Means\",\n       title = paste(\"Sampling Distribution of the \\nSample Mean when n =\", n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also obtain some summary statistics of the sampling distribution of the sample mean when \\(n\\) = 5:\n\nmeans_df |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_samp_dist = mean(means),\n            var_samp_dist = var(means),\n            sd_samp_dist = sd(means))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  mean_samp_dist var_samp_dist sd_samp_dist\n           &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           9.99         0.822        0.907\n\n\nAnd, we can even obtain estimates of the probability that we observe a sample mean larger than 11 by calculating the proportion of our observed sample means that are larger than 11. We can use a similar strategy to estimate the probability that we observe a sample mean less than or equal to 9.5.\n\n# What is the probability that we observe a sample mean larger than 11?\nmeans_df |&gt;\n  mutate(more_than_11 = if_else(means &gt; 11,\n                                true = 1, false = 0)) |&gt;\n  summarise(prob_more_than_11 = mean(more_than_11))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  prob_more_than_11\n              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             0.135\n\n# What is the probability that we observe a sample mean less than or equal to 9.5?\nmeans_df |&gt;\n  mutate(less_9.5 = if_else(means &lt;= 9.5,\n                            true = 1, false = 0)) |&gt;\n  summarise(prob_less_9.5 = mean(less_9.5))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  prob_less_9.5\n          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         0.297\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1. Repeat the construction of the sampling distribution of the sample mean several times. How do the results change (or not)?\nExercise 2. Use the result from Stat 325 to report the theoretical distribution of the sample mean. Use this result to find \\(P(\\bar{Y}\\leq 9.5)\\) and \\(P(\\bar{Y}&gt;11)\\) analytically.\nExercise 3. What can we conclude about the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{y}\\) when taking samples of \\(n = 5\\) from this population? How do the simulation results compare to the result from Stat 325? Use the plot below in your answer to this question.\n\ntheoretical_df &lt;- tibble(xvals = seq(mu - 4 * sigma / sqrt(n),\n                                     mu + 4 * sigma / sqrt(n),\n                                     length.out = 500)) |&gt;\n  mutate(xvals_density = dnorm(xvals, mu, sigma / sqrt(n)))\n\nggplot(data = means_df, aes(x = means)) +\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"deeppink4\", fill = \"deeppink1\", bins = 20,\n                 aes(y = after_stat(density))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Observed Sample Means\",\n       title = paste(\"Sampling Distribution of the \\nSample Mean when n =\", n)) +\n  geom_line(data = theoretical_df, aes(x = xvals, y = xvals_density))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4. Increase the sample size to 50 and then reconstruct the sampling distribution of the sample mean for \\(n = 50\\). How do the results (mean, standard deviation, and probabilities) change? Do the changes make sense and do they match the theoretical result from Stat 325?",
